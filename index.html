            Cows are large animals, with a fully grown cow weighing anywhere from 1,000 to 1,800 pounds. They have a large
            body, a long head, and a long tail. Their skin is covered with hair that can be of various colors, including

            Cows are found all over the world, in every continent except Antarctica. They are adaptable animals that can
            live in a variety of environments, from grasslands to forests. Cows are herbivores and spend most of their day
            grazing.
        </p>
        <h2>Importance to Humans</h2>
